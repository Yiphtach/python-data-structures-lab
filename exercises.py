# Welcome to the Python Data Structures Lab!

# In this lab, you’ll practice working with different data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. By manipulating these data structures, you’ll gain a better understanding of how to organize and store data effectively in your Python programs.

# By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

# Create and modify lists and tuples.
# Utilize dictionaries for more complex data storage.
# Iterate over data structures using loops.
# Apply Python’s slicing and indexing features to access data.

# Getting Started

# For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named exercises.py.
# Each exercise includes a function where you will write your code. The function structure helps you focus on working with the specific data structure required.
# Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the code.
# After completing each exercise, run python3 exercises.py in your terminal to see the output and test your code.
# If you encounter difficulties with the syntax for data structures, review the provided lesson materials or collaborate with your classmates.


# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.

def example_list_function():
  example_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
  for element in example_list:
      print(element)

# Call the function and print each element
example_list_function()


# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.


def manage_students_function():
    # your code here
    students = ['John', 'Frank', 'Elzabeth']
    for student in students:
        print(student)
    first_student = students[0]
    last_student = students[-1]
    return first_student, last_student

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students_function())


# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    # your code here
    foods = ['chicken','rice', 'beans']
    meal = ()
    for food in foods:
        meal += (food,)
    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())


# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    # your code here
    foods = ('chicken','rice', 'beans')
    last_two_foods = foods[-2:]
    return last_two_foods

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())


# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    # your code here
    home_town = {'city': 'Brooklyn', 'state': 'New York', 'population': '3 billion'}
    home_town_message = f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}"
    return home_town_message

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())



# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

#def list_home_town_items():
    # your code here

# Call the function and print the result
#print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
